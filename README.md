## Reinforcement-Learning-and-DeepRL
##### There are two implementations of reinforcement learning.
##### One is classic RL including concepts and algorithms:
###### 1. n arms bandit probelm - exploration and exploitation test with epsilon greedy policy
###### 2. Value iteration v.s. policy evaluation and iteration.(based on dp, model-based)
###### 3. Q-learning and Sarsa (model-free algorithms)
##### Another part is Deep RL where we implment DQN
###### DQN here is going to solve a famous Cartpole game. And we use 'gym' to get the game environment.
###### This part is based on tensorflow so two networks are built in the algorithm.
###### The script is run on Google-Colab platform.
